  <h3>About the Author</h3>
  <div>
    <p>I created this website to help others find their way through spiritual awakening. When I stepped back, examined the structure of my life and decided to work through my pain, trauma, habits and a plethora of other things I began to see that I was the reason for my suffering. This is not to say that I deserve to suffer or it’s my fault, it means the continuation of suffering is a choice I make because it is easier than working through it, to process, self-examine and correct my behavior. Even if I wanted to correct it or work through it, I had no idea how to do it. This is when I started meditating, learning about my energy fields and most importantly, realizing that the light I needed, to find my way, was already part of me.
 We all have our own path, no one is better or more enlightened and we all have our issues. A spiritual journey is personal, it is yours. I cuss like a sailor sometimes and that does not make me any less worthy of enlightenment or that I am not working towards a higher state of consciousness it means it is my path to review and correct not anyone else’s. It is not about perfection but about self-reflection to learn how to heal, protect and love yourself.
